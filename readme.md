## Practise round: Anagram Hunter

My great Aunt Ethel is a bit of a scrabble fanatic and she has heard that you are now a coding ninja.

She would like you to create a program that given a word and a list of words will find an available anagram.

Luckily Aunt Ethel is only interested in words of 3 letters. She has been given:

the letters: "cat";

and the words list:

["try","how","eat","far","act","see","hit","lie","key","tac","sit","its","tea"]

Write a program that will select all the anagrams of "cat" from the list provided.
